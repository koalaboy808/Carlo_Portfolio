                  The ever-changing nature of the technology sector
                  makes it difficult for people to wrap their heads around on what exactly is going on inside
                  this world. We have chosen to apply a data-driven storytelling approach to illuminate some
                  trends as we drill down into the CrunchBase dataset.
                </br></br>
                  Our interface is designed to allow users to see different high-level views of the data. In the
                  interface we are asking many questions about the data, such as where the majority of VC
                  funding is coming from and into what startup markets. However we aim to allow users to
                  explore their own angles of inquiry. Although we are not providing any answers as to why
                  different VCs and startups fail or succeed, we hope to allow users to compare different
                  aspects of the data and compare overall trends. They can see amounts of funding reported
                  and received from different countries, compare funding between markets and and against
                  the total and averages of all markets, and contrast funding reported in all startup markets
                  with those valued at $1 billion (Unicorns) which is one metric of startup success. We also
                  cleaned and selected the data from the past ten years, which seemed to be the richest
                  reporting of funding. By creating these visualizations we are helping the user make sense of
                  the data at a high level, where they might want to pursue further, more detailed, inquiries
                  after looking at the bigger picture or if this dataset mimics or differs from other resources
                  related to VCs and startups.

                  The design
                  for the visualization was inspired by the current aesthetics in startup and VC culture,
                  particularly that of financial related media such as Forbes. By using serif fonts for
                  the title and body text and sans serif fonts for the section title as well as bordered boxes for
                  containing and connecting different pieces of information, the interface took a
                  contemporary spin on classic business visual styles. Using a single page site for layering and
                  displaying the different information and visualizations was another design choice to keep an
                  editorial look. Additionally, we utilized a floating side menu of our questions as the
                  dominant navigation for the page, which also mimics the covers’ use of side text to ask
                  questions that tell the narrative of the content.

                  This exploratory data analysis was crucial for the development of our final visualization. We
                  decided to focus on the interplay between market, time and space. From our user studies,
                  we deduced that users were most interested in this combination. Showing the multitude of
                  intricate layers behind the dataset and the venture capitalist and startup scene made this
                  problem even more difficult. Thus the final visualization starts very general and becomes progressively more detailed, aiming to show different
                  and interesting angles of the data. This initial analysis also demonstrated the nuances of
                  the dataset—namely the concentrated distribution in both market and country.

                  Our usability tests with fellow MIMS students focused on the clarity of the visualization. Our
                  initial charts and premise resulted in complex combinations of graphs and we wanted to
                  make sure that they were understandable by our audience. This involved the correct spacing
                  between elements to understand grouping and sufficient labeling to support
                  comprehension. During the initial design phase, we prototyped a world map with money
                  bubbles and another bubble chart divided by market. The feedback we received was
                  regarding the usefulness of these graphs and to tweak them accordingly.
              </br></br>
                  Despite our efforts to make this visualization a deep drilldown into each startup without
                  overwhelming users with too much data, many had difficulties in interpreting the
                  visualization. After careful description of the two bar graphs, it became apparent how these
                  visualizations functioned and why they were important. However, it was not easily
                  ascertained without a comprehensive description. For instance, many users could not
                  deduce which market in the ‘All Startups’ column matched to which market in the ‘Unicorn
                  Startups’ column. We had decided to normalize the scales by relative maximum value, as
                  using the raw number would dwarf the column with only unicorns. In this way, the user
                  could compare and contrast how unicorns compared to all startups on a relative scale.
                  However, this again confused the user as to how these values were represented. In the
                  future, we would make greater efforts into making this more readable. An easy solution
                  would be to annotate our graphs much more. A second option would be to create a
                  scatterplot by market with total funding on one axis and unicorn funding on another
                  axis.While we were able to make some configurations for this submission, we will consider
                  the other suggestions as implementations of future work.
